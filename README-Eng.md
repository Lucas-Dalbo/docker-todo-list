# Docker Todo List Project
This project was developed while a student at Trybe, in the Back-End module.

All of the code of the react aplication was developed by the Trybe developers.
The code I developed was for the back-end of it, that means the Dockerfiles, Docker Compose and the commands at docker-commands.

## What was learn?
How to use Docker to run an aplication using shell, Dockerfile and Docker Compose.

Then with the construction of images from the Dockerfile and, finally, in the junction of all the concepts, with a docker-compose.yml that runs the application Todo-List.
